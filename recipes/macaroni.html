    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tuna, macaroni, creamy soup, cheese and fried onions are all you need to make this super easy tuna casserole that I learned from my roommate. It's great as leftovers, too. <br> <br> Slice chicken and bacon into 1-inch strips. Freeze for 15 to 30 minutes (this will make the meat easier to grind). Cut bread into 1-inch strips or cubes. If bread is still moist, dry it out in a 250° F oven for 10 to 15 minutes. You don’t want to brown the bread, just thoroughly dry it out. Whisk together salt, pepper, sage, onion powder, ground ginger, thyme, white pepper, and nutmeg in a small bowl. Sprinkle evenly over the meat. Attach the fine blade from the KitchenAid® Food Grinder Attachment to the power hub of the KitchenAid® Stand Mixer. Place a bowl underneath to catch the ground meat and turn the Stand Mixer to speed 4. Feed strips of meat down the feed tube, using the food pusher as needed. Alternate strips of meat with a piece of bread to grind it evenly throughout.</p>
